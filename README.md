# Coursera Algorithms Projects

## 1 Introduction

In this repository, I've packed my implementation of projects in the Algorithms course on Coursera by Professor Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.

## 2 Small Tips for Running with arguments

Many projects in this course need to run with certain arguments (i.e., file names). For Intellij Idea, there is an easier way for running with arguments:

1. Right-click the inputFiles folder and choose **Mark Directory as Resources root/ Test Resources root**.
2. When running the program, click on **current file** from the top, and choose **More Actions** (the three dots), click on **Run with Parameters**.
3. In the **Build and Run** of **Edit Configuration Settings** window, choose the class you want to run, and type in the path of the file for **Program Arguments** (For Example, inputFiles/input.txt)
4. Click on **Run** and now the program runs with parameters!
